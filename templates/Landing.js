        The Holy Mountain is a genre-defying and critically acclaimed synth-pop
        trio from Norway. With their conceptually unique style and taste for the
        dark and transcendental, the band is described as a cross between the TV
        series Twin Peaks and the American synth-pop act Beach House (US), with
        clear roots in classical minimalism.
