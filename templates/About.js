          The Holy Mountain is a genre-defying trio from Oslo, Norge that moves
          between jazz, electronic synth music, alternative pop, and minimalism.
          The band's sound combines accordion, vocals, synth and drums to create
          unique and conceptual music.

          In 2023, the band released "The Dawns Here Are Quiet," an 8-track
          studio album blending experimental jazz and alternative pop inspired
          by the poetry of Arseny Tarkovsky and Nordic cinema. 3 years prior, in
          2020, The Holy Mountain released "Ending it All Tonight", a
          full-fledged electronic studio album with 10 tracks inspired by
          synthwave, vaporwave, and 80s aesthetics. The bands instrumental
          debut, "Toad of Light", surfaced in 2018 and was a testament to sci-fi
          film music and the psychedelic movement in 70s pop culture.

          Already in early 2024, the trio is ready with their next EP, "They Are
          Asleep", an upbeat breath of fresh air in their musical career. With
          this release, the band's characteristic melancholic sound is mixed
          with new sources of inspiration, such as Y2K-techno and synth-pop.
