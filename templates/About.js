        The Holy Mountain is a genre-defying trio from Oslo, Norway, that moves
        between jazz, electronic synth music, alternative pop, and minimalism.
        The band&apos;s sound combines accordion, vocals, synth and drums to
        create unique and conceptual music.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a four-track EP/demo in 2015, The Holy Mountain&apos;s debut
        studio album, <i>Toad of Light</i>, surfaced on Shhpuma Clean Feed
        Records in 2018, featuring accordion, synth and drums. The four-part
        instrumental release was a testament to dystopian sci-fi visions and
        cult-aesthetics, themes that would follow the band further into the
        future. Two years later, the duo became a trio and ventured deeper into
        the void with <i>Ending it All Tonight</i>, a fully-fledged electronic
        synth album inspired by synthwave, vaporwave, and dystopian 80s
        aesthetics.

        But the band&apos;s next studio album would department from the
        previous, and see the trio explore new musical grounds.{" "}
        <i>The Dawns Here Are Quiet</i> (2023) saw the band return to their
        original instrumentation, with added vocals, and combine experimental
        and contemporary jazz with alternative and melancholic pop. This
        eight-track studio album has inspirational ties to the poetry of Arseny
        Tarkovsky, nordic jazz and art cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
        Already in early 2024, the trio is ready with their next EP,
        <i>They Are Asleep</i>, an upbeat breath of fresh air in their musical
        career. With this release, the band&apos;s characteristic melancholic
        sound is mixed with new sources of inspiration, such as techno, sci-fi
        horror and synth-pop.
